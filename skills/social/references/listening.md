# Social Listening & Engagement Triage

How to surface the right posts to engage with each day — instead of randomly scrolling. The goal is a short, scorable list ("here are your top 10 posts to comment on") rather than an open feed.

## When to Use This

Use listening when the goal is **commenting and relationships**, not posting. Typical asks:
- "Give me the top 10 posts I should comment on today"
- "Who's complaining about [competitor] right now?"
- "Find people asking for a tool like mine"
- "Surface posts from my 20 target accounts in the last 24h"
- "What's the conversation around [topic] this week?"

If the user wants to **create** content, use the rest of the social skill. Listening feeds creation (it surfaces angles, language, objections), but the output is different.

## The Daily Triage Loop

A repeatable 20-minute loop the user (or you, on their behalf) can run each morning.

1. **Pull** — fetch new posts from defined sources (target accounts, keywords,
   subreddits, hashtags). See
   [tooling](#sources--typed-hosted-agent-actions).
2. **Filter** — drop anything older than 24h, low signal, or off-topic.
3. **Score** — apply the [rubric](#scoring-rubric). Keep top 10.
4. **Draft** — for each, draft a comment matched to the post's tier.
5. **Post** — user reviews, edits, posts. Mark which actually went live.
6. **Log** — track what you commented on and what got replies. This is your engagement loop dataset.

Output format Claude should produce:

```
TOP 10 POSTS — 2026-06-05

1. [Score 9/10] @author — LinkedIn — 2h ago
   "We just rolled out X and the team is loving it…"
   Why: ICP fit (B2B SaaS, 50–200 employees), buying-intent signal
   Suggested comment: [draft]
   Link: https://…
```

## Scoring Rubric

Score each post 1–10 across five dimensions, then sum and rank.

| Dimension | What it measures | Weight |
|-----------|------------------|--------|
| **ICP fit** | Is the author your target customer / influencer? | 2x |
| **Intent signal** | Are they expressing a problem, asking, or shopping? | 2x |
| **Reach potential** | Is the post getting traction (likes/comments rising)? | 1x |
| **Comment opportunity** | Can you say something genuinely useful, not generic? | 2x |
| **Recency** | Posted in last 1–4h (early comments win, especially on LinkedIn) | 1x |

**Intent signal examples (high-value):**
- "Looking for a tool that does X"
- "Why is [category] so painful?"
- "We just switched from [competitor] because…"
- "Anyone use [competitor] — is it worth it?"
- A complaint about a known competitor

**Drop if any of these are true:**
- Author isn't ICP and isn't an influencer
- Post is >24h old and already has 50+ comments (your comment buries)
- Generic motivational/AI-slop post
- Self-promotion thread where comments don't get reach
- You can't add anything beyond "Great post!"

---

## Comment Quality Tiers

Match the comment to the post. Don't waste a tier-1 draft on a tier-3 opportunity.

**Tier 1 — Relationship builder (target accounts, ICP, high intent)**
- Add a specific insight or counter-example
- Reference your own experience with specifics (numbers, names, outcomes)
- Ask a thoughtful follow-up that invites a reply
- Length: 2–4 sentences, no link

**Tier 2 — Visibility play (high-reach post, adjacent topic)**
- Add one sharp insight in one sentence
- Pattern: "Agreed — and the part most miss is [X]"
- Length: 1–2 sentences

**Tier 3 — Light touch (relationship maintenance)**
- Specific reaction, not "Love this"
- Quote a specific line and react to it
- Length: 1 sentence

**Never:** "Great post!", emoji-only, "+1", LinkedIn-isms like "This is gold 🔥"

## Sources & Typed Hosted Agent Actions

Shell networking is unavailable. Never call a public feed or API from a shell,
even when it needs no authentication.

Use this reviewed order:

1. Use the `magister-social-research` skill and
   `magister_integration_read` for its documented Reddit, YouTube, LinkedIn,
   and other supported social-search routes.
2. Use `magister-exa` through the typed read action for recent web results and
   known-page contents.
3. Use `magister-firecrawl` through the typed read action when a public page or
   feed needs rendering or extraction.
4. If none of those reviewed actions represents the exact source, return
   `execution_unavailable` and give the user a direct page to inspect. Do not
   substitute a shell request or invent a provider credential.

Keep `KEYWORD`, subreddit, channel, time range, and pagination values in the
typed action's documented query/body fields. Normalize successful results into
the Top 10 format above before scoring them.

### LinkedIn & X — reviewed access only

Prefer the typed social-research routes. An attended browser may be used only
when that browser tool is actually advertised in the current session and the
user controls its authenticated state. Hosted Agent browser automation is not
a fallback: when no reviewed social route or attended browser exists, return
`execution_unavailable` and ask the user to paste the posts or export a list.

**Useful URLs for the user or an explicitly available attended browser:**

| URL pattern | What it shows |
|-------------|---------------|
| `linkedin.com/in/HANDLE/recent-activity/all/` | A target account's recent posts |
| `linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/TOPIC/` | Hashtag feed |
| `linkedin.com/feed/` | Your main feed (algorithmic — less useful for triage) |
| `x.com/HANDLE` | A target account's profile |
| `x.com/search?q=QUERY&f=live` | Real-time search (use `f=live` for chronological) |
| `x.com/i/lists/LIST_ID` | A curated list — best for target accounts |

**Tips:**
- On X, build a private list of target accounts and use the list URL. Far cleaner than the algorithmic feed.
- LinkedIn's `/recent-activity/all/` URL is the cleanest way to see one person's posts without the algorithm.
- For both platforms, scroll programmatically (dev-browser supports it) to load more posts before extracting.

**Paid alternatives if you don't want to drive a browser:**

| Platform | Tools |
|----------|-------|
| LinkedIn | Sales Navigator (saved searches), Taplio (engagement) |
| X | TweetDeck/X Pro (saved columns), Typefully, Taplio, Tweet Hunter |

**Still closed (no good path):**
- Instagram & TikTok — closed APIs, browser automation is detectable and risky. Use native saved searches / hashtag follows.

## Per-Platform Notes

### LinkedIn
- **Reviewed route or attended browser only** — see
  [LinkedIn & X — reviewed access only](#linkedin--x--reviewed-access-only)
- **First-hour comments matter most** — algorithm weights early engagement heavily. Prioritize posts <2h old from target accounts.
- Comments with 5+ words get more reach than reactions
- Replying to other commenters can put you in front of their network
- Tag the author in your reply only if it adds context

### Twitter/X
- **Reviewed route or attended browser only** — build a private list of target
  accounts and use it only through a currently advertised tool
- Reply within first 30 min for max reach on big accounts
- Quote-tweet > reply when adding substantial value
- Threading your reply (multi-tweet) signals effort
- Don't pile on dunks — relationships > clout

### Reddit
- Read the subreddit rules before commenting (some ban self-promotion outright)
- Earn karma in the sub before linking to anything you own
- Long, specific answers win. AMAs and "help me decide" threads are gold
- Never lead with your product — answer the question first

### Hacker News
- Comment quality bar is high; low-effort gets downvoted fast
- Founders commenting on threads about their product is welcomed if you're transparent
- Search for past discussions of your category — they're often dormant gold mines

### Bluesky
- Smaller volume but high engagement-to-follower ratio
- Tech and indie-hacker communities are active
- Custom feeds (like Bluesky's "Following" + topic feeds) replace algorithmic search

## Common Workflows

### "Give me my top 10 posts to comment on today"
1. Pull from: target account RSS/saved searches + Reddit (relevant subs) + HN (last 24h)
2. Score with the [rubric](#scoring-rubric)
3. Output top 10 with suggested comments

### "Find people complaining about [competitor]"
1. Reddit search: `"competitor name" -site:competitor.com` sorted by new
2. HN comment search for competitor name
3. Bluesky search for competitor handle/name
4. Score by intent signal (high if switching language: "moving from", "alternatives to", "frustrated with")

### "Surface brand mentions from the last week"
1. Reddit search for brand name
2. HN search (stories + comments) for brand name
3. Bluesky search for brand name + handle
4. Output as: reply needed (yes/no), tone (positive/negative/neutral), suggested response

### "Find target-account posts I missed"
1. Maintain a list of target accounts with their RSS / Reddit usernames / Bluesky handles
2. Fetch each source's recent posts
3. Filter to last 24h, output sorted by score

## Setting Up the Source List

The user should maintain a list of sources somewhere persistent at `.agents/listening-sources.md` (or `.claude/listening-sources.md`). Claude reads it when running the daily loop.

**A ready-to-fill template lives at [listening-sources-template.md](listening-sources-template.md).** Copy it into the project and edit. The source path depends on how the skill was installed:

```bash
# Plugin / marketplace install (most common):
cp .agents/skills/social/references/listening-sources-template.md .agents/listening-sources.md
# .claude/ install:
cp .claude/skills/social/references/listening-sources-template.md .agents/listening-sources.md
# Working inside the marketingskills repo:
cp skills/social/references/listening-sources-template.md .agents/listening-sources.md
```

The template covers: brand/category, ICP (for scoring), target accounts per platform, intent keywords, subreddits, saved-search URLs, and a do-not-engage list.
